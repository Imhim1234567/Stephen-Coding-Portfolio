This is another project I did in the beginning of the year. 
We were tasked to make discord bots in python after learning the basics structure of how discord bots work.
Since at this time of the year I was working on myself and my ability to better my life I decided that it would be a good idea to have my bot feed me inspirational quotes everyday

After a good month on working on this bot I was infortunatley was never able to get it to work the way I wanted to
This was because of a multitiude of reasons but the main reason is because of my lack of effort I put into developing not only this project, but my python skills.
Later, I might revsit this project because I believe that it is something that can be life-changing for me  specifically.
