This project was our summer assignment that was due the first week of school.
We were asked to construct a card game with our knowledge of coding we had from the previous year.
For this project I used a refrence video to get the base of my project
I went in myself and added a way to restart the game of war.
If I were to do this projec again I would try to do it completley by myself
I would also add more of a user interface so my project would get that card game type of feel.
